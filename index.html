This practice helps alleviate eye strain and fatigue caused by prolonged screen time or intense focus on study materials. By giving your eyes periodic rest, you can maintain better focus and concentration over longer study sessions. Implementing the 20-20 rule can enhance productivity and reduce the risk of developing eye-related discomfort or issues associated with extended screen use.
